%================== OBJECT 1 ==================
\section{Lecture ``On Mathematical Maturity'' (Thomas Garrity)}

\qa{What is the object?}{A recorded lecture by mathematician Thomas Garrity on ``mathematical maturity.''}
\qa{Real-world context / history:}{Delivered in 2017 to undergraduates and K–12 educators, the talk frames mathematical maturity as the intuition and creativity needed to tackle unfamiliar problems.}
\qa{Relation to the prompt:}{While published proofs in mathematics are objective, the \emph{production} of such knowledge relies on subjective elements (intuition, pattern-spotting, abstraction). Hence, mathematics blends an objective end state with subjective means, limiting complete objectivity in its creation.}

\section{Gua Sha Tool (Traditional Chinese Medicine)}

\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.38\textwidth}

    \includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{guasha.jpg}
  \end{center}
\end{wrapfigure}

\qa{What is the object?}{A scraping tool used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), believed to “release toxins.”}
\qa{Real-world context / history:}{Practiced for centuries and transmitted culturally (e.g., gifted within families), Gua Sha persists despite a lack of support from evidence-based biomedicine and known risks like skin damage.}
\qa{Relation to the prompt:}{Scientific medicine aims at objectivity through falsifiability, controls, and statistics; TCM often appeals to tradition and anecdote. Divergent standards of justification reveal how cultural commitments constrain the attainment and spread of objective medical knowledge.}

\section{Ravel — \emph{Piano Concerto for the Left Hand in D major}}
\ 
\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.38\textwidth}

  \end{center}
\end{wrapfigure}

\qa{What is the object?}{A concerto composed by Maurice Ravel for pianist Paul Wittgenstein, who lost his right hand in World War~I.}
\qa{Real-world context / history:}{Popular summaries cast it as an inspiring gesture of compassion; in fact, it was a paid commission, and later disputes arose over Wittgenstein's departures from Ravel's score.}
\qa{Relation to the prompt:}{Short-form, emotionally charged retellings simplify and omit complexities, shaping what audiences “know.” Historical knowledge is filtered through selection and perspective, so complete objectivity in history is elusive.}
